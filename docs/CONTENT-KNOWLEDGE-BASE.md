## 📚 HVAC TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Common Issue #1: System Not Turning On

**Quick Checks:**
1. **Thermostat Settings**
   - Verify thermostat is set to correct mode (Heat/Cool/Auto)
   - Check temperature setpoint is appropriate
   - Replace batteries if applicable
   - Ensure thermostat display is lit

2. **Circuit Breaker**
   - Locate electrical panel
   - Find breakers labeled "HVAC," "AC," or "Furnace"
   - Check if breaker is tripped (switch in middle position)
   - Reset: flip OFF completely, then back to ON
   - If breaker trips again immediately, call for service

3. **Emergency Shut-Off Switch**
   - Check wall switch near indoor unit (looks like light switch)
   - Ensure it's in ON position
   - Often accidentally turned off during cleaning

**When to Call Support:**
- Breaker trips repeatedly
- Burning smell detected
- Strange noises (grinding, squealing, banging)
- Water leaking from unit

### Common Issue #2: Poor Heating or Cooling

**Causes & Solutions:**

1. **Dirty Air Filter** (Most Common - 40% of issues)
   - Replace every 30-90 days depending on usage
   - Clogged filters reduce airflow by up to 50%
   - Can cause system to overheat and shut down
   - **Action**: Check filter monthly, replace when dirty

2. **Blocked Vents or Registers**
   - Ensure all supply vents are open
   - Remove furniture/equipment blocking airflow
   - Check return air grilles are unobstructed

3. **Refrigerant Issues**
   - Low refrigerant = poor cooling performance
   - Signs: Ice buildup on outdoor unit, hissing sounds
   - **Requires professional service** - do not DIY

4. **Thermostat Placement**
   - Should not be in direct sunlight
   - Keep away from heat sources (gym equipment, windows)
   - Calibration may drift over time

### Common Issue #3: Uneven Temperature Distribution

**Troubleshooting:**
- Check all zone dampers are functioning
- Verify airflow at all registers
- Inspect ductwork for leaks (common in older facilities)
- Consider SES 24-hour temperature monitoring service

**SES Solution**: Our AI-driven energy management system provides:
- Real-time temperature monitoring across all zones

   - Cost: $20-50/month in filters vs. $500+ in wasted energy

2. **Thermostat Settings**
   - Recommended: 72°F in summer, 68°F in winter during hours
   - Set back 5-7°F during closed hours (saves 10-15% on costs)

3. **Regular Maintenance**
   - Quarterly inspections reduce energy costs by 15-25%
   - Prevents costly emergency repairs
   - Extends equipment life by 30-40%

## 🎯 STEPH'S RESPONSE GUIDELINES (For AI Training)

### Tone & Style
- Friendly, professional, and helpful
- Use clear, jargon-free language
- Break complex issues into simple steps
- Provide actionable solutions
- Always include emergency contact for urgent issues

### Response Structure
1. **Acknowledge the question**: Show you understand their concern
2. **Provide immediate action**: Quick fix they can try now
3. **Explain the why**: Brief education about the issue
4. **Offer next steps**: What to do if quick fix doesn't work
5. **Include contact info**: Phone numbers, email, or portal links

### Example Response Pattern

**User**: "My AC isn't cooling properly"

**Cathy**: "I understand how uncomfortable that must be! Let's troubleshoot this together.

**First, try these quick fixes:**
1. Check your thermostat - is it set to 'Cool' and below current room temperature?
2. Replace or check your air filter - a clogged filter is the #1 cause of poor cooling
3. Make sure all vents are open and unobstructed

**Why this happens:**
Most cooling issues come from restricted airflow (dirty filter) or incorrect thermostat settings. These account for 60% of 'no cooling' calls!

**If this doesn't help:**
You may have low refrigerant or a failing compressor. This requires professional service.
