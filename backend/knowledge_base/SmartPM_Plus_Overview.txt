COMMON QUESTIONS & DETAILED ANSWERS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Q1: What is SmartPM Plus™?
A: SmartPM Plus™ is an AI-driven predictive maintenance and energy management 
solution that works alongside your existing PM program. It combines advanced 
DLC technology with 24/7 Virtual Facility Management (vFM™), full asset tracking 
(SmartAssetCare™), and delivers 20-30% energy savings from Day 1. Think of it 
as adding a layer of intelligence and 24/7 oversight to your current HVAC setup.

Q2: How much does SmartPM Plus™ cost?
A: $0 upfront. SmartPM Plus™ uses your existing PM budget - it's not a new line 
item. The service operates on a quarterly OPEX invoicing model. You get all 
equipment, installation, 24/7 monitoring, and quarterly PM service included. 
With a 36-month partnership and 12-month exit clause, you can cancel if value 
isn't delivered within the first year.

Q3: Do I need to replace my current PM vendor?
A: No! You have options. SmartPM Plus™ works WITH your existing PM program. 
You can keep your current vendor and we add intelligence (monitoring, 
predictive alerts, energy optimization), OR we can take over quarterly PM 
services. Your choice - whatever makes most sense for your operation.

Q4: What energy savings can I expect?
A: 20-30% HVAC energy savings starting on Day 1. This has been proven across 
600+ locations nationwide with over $2.5M in verified client savings. These 
savings are achieved through AI-driven optimization, predictive maintenance 
that prevents energy waste, and 24/7 monitoring that keeps systems running 
efficiently. Savings typically offset the service cost.

Q5: What if SmartPM Plus™ doesn't work for my facility?
A: 36-month partnership with a 12-month performance exit clause. If energy 
savings or FM value aren't delivered within 12 months, you can cancel - no 
questions asked, no penalties. This is our guarantee that we'll deliver real 
value or you can walk away.

Q6: How long does installation take? Will there be downtime?
A: Installation takes 4-6 hours per site. It's a same-day wireless installation 
with NO HVAC downtime and minimal disruption to your operations. Our team 
installs during business hours, provides training, and ensures everything is 
working before we leave.

Q7: What's included in the SmartPM Plus™ service?
A: Per RTU: Smart thermostat, zone sensor with humidity, supply sensor, and 
quarterly PM service. Additional services: vFM™ (24/7 Virtual Facility 
Management), SmartAssetCare™ (full asset tracking), software platform (desktop 
& mobile apps), professional installation, training, 5-year warranty, and 
dedicated support team.

Q8: How is SmartPM Plus™ different from traditional PM?
A: SmartPM Plus™ is predictive, not reactive. Traditional PM waits for 
breakdowns and provides scheduled maintenance only. SmartPM Plus™ uses AI to 
catch failures before they happen, provides 24/7 monitoring, delivers immediate 
energy savings (20-30%), and includes a complete managed service (vFM™) that 
handles vendor coordination and issue resolution. It's the difference between 
"wait and react" vs "predict and prevent."

Q9: Who manages the system? Do I need extra staff?
A: Our vFM™ (Virtual Facility Management) team manages the system 24/7. You 
don't need extra staff. Our team monitors equipment, triages alerts, coordinates 
vendor responses, and handles issue resolution. You get notified about what 
matters - not woken up for false alarms.

Q10: What if I have multiple locations?
A: Perfect! SmartPM Plus™ is designed for multi-site management. The platform 
provides corporate overview capabilities, allowing you to manage all locations 
from one dashboard. We've deployed across 1,000+ sites nationwide, so we 
understand the challenges of multi-location operations.

Q11: How quickly can I see results?
A: Immediately. Energy savings start from Day 1 of installation. Predictive 
maintenance benefits build over the first few months as the AI learns your 
equipment patterns. Most customers see ROI within the first quarter due to 
energy savings and reduced emergency repair costs.

Q12: What kind of support do I get?
A: 24/7 support through multiple channels:
• vFM™ team monitoring equipment around the clock
• Dedicated account manager for your account
• 24/7 emergency support line: (617) 564-4800
• Email support: support@saveenergysystems.com
• Desktop and mobile app access
• Regular business reviews to optimize performance
